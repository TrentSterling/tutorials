# THE 20 GAMES CHALLENGE

Inspired by [20_games_challenge](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/challenge/), this is a structured path to mastering game development. Each game introduces a new technical hurdle.

## The Path
1. **Pong** (Basic Physics/Input)
2. **Flappy Bird** (Procedural Obstacles)
3. **Breakout** (Collision Responses)
4. **Space Invaders** (Bullet Management)
5. **Pacman** (Grid AI/Pathfinding)
... and so on.

## Tront's Twist
Instead of just making the games, we will implement them using the high-performance techniques in this hub (e.g., Pong with SAT, Pacman with Flow Fields).
